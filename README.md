Project Overview:
The project was to create a snake game, which would utilize the engine from the world popular mini game, but translate that logic into Android Studios Kotlin.

What I did do?
A snake game
A menu screen
A local data storage solution for usernames and scores
A multi view app with lots of scalability and dependencies in mind
Procrastinate

Wish list of features for the next version:
Skins for the snake/app when you reach a certain score
Make the game a bit more interesting, like adding obstacles or foes
Music
Some animations in the menu
Self-evaluation:
My grade could be average, but at the same time, I feel as if we were not expected to make a groundbreaking app right from one semester of learning Android Studio. I believe I gave my best, and I hope to someday use this knowledge for my future endeavors.

Regarding the app structure and components, they are sorted based on if they belong in the data, domain or presentation layer (I found on some forums and videos mentioning this, but it is pretty much just MVP sorting). Data consists of files that save player and score data, domain is for the backend, and presentation is for frontend.
